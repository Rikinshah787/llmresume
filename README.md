## Deploying to Vercel

This repository includes an optional `vercel.json` file with a basic configuration suitable for static sites or simple build setups. You can customize the `distDir` or build command depending on your framework. To deploy:

- Connect this repository in the Vercel dashboard (https://vercel.com) and pick the appropriate build settings.
- If you want me to push to a new GitHub remote and trigger a Vercel deploy, provide the remote URL or give me the go-ahead to create a GitHub repo.

The provided `vercel.json` is a starting point and may be adjusted for frameworks like Next.js, Gatsby, or static HTML builds.
