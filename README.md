Landing page
-------------

A modern one-page dark landing page has been added under `public/` with glassmorphism styling and a galaxy-like background. Files added:

- `public/index.html` — landing page (hero, signup placeholder)
- `public/styles.css` — styles for dark glass UI
- `public/assets/hero.svg` — placeholder visual (replace with your image)

This page uses a non-functional signup placeholder (JavaScript alert). Replace or wire up a real backend or mailing list integration when ready.
